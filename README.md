# greenhouse.io

# About the Project

## About this Repository
This is a PaaS deployment of my greenhouse measurements software containing only the pertinent software components allowing it to function on the cloud.  Unlike the base version, it cannot access a local database, only a remote database hosted by MongoDB Atlas.

## URL
https://greenhouse-io.herokuapp.com/

*Note: The front end of this application is currently in development.  The contents of index.js are shown as a placeholder.*

## Basic Functionality 
The bulk of greenhouse.io's current implementation revolves around the models and routes associated with the greenhouse data (given the lack of a front end, there can be no *true* MVC implementation in this application presently).
